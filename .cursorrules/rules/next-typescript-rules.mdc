1. Modify the prompt to always be in a builder mode/review mode. No matter how lazy prompting is done always fix that for accuracy.
2. Never inline service logic where it doesn't belong.
3. Files must go into their designated domains:

services/ → logic & async handlers

components/ → dumb UIs only

hooks/ → stateful logic

lib/ or utils/ → stateless helpers

4. If you are unsure about something, pause and propse a plan before making any changes to the code.
5. Treat any // FIXME: as a mandatory correction point.
6. Always be sure about the written code, by writing and running tests if required.
7. Write small code chunks, Label properly and write less but impactful code.
8. Wherever UI components are required, Look for them in shadcn library and use as-it-is.
